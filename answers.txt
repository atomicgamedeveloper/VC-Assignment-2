Reflection Questions
1. In Part 2, what is the purpose of a vertex shader versus a fragment
shader?

The vertex shader rasterizes the primitives, figuring out where to put the triangle,
which overlaps which, while the fragment shader then colours the result of the
vertex shader.

2. In Part 3, why is it necessary to call update() method on videoTexture
inside the main loop? What would happen if you didn’t?

It fetches a new frame. Otherwise we would be stuck with the first frame forever.

3. What might happen if the video’s aspect ratio and the quad’s aspect
ratio do not match?
